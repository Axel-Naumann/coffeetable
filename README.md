# Coffee Table! ☕

It's a [web-app](https://axel-naumann.github.io/coffeetable/)!

# 😞

Suppose you don't manage to have coffees with your colleagues.
Maybe you have new colleagues you don't even really know, because you never met them, you never hang out. 

# 👫👫👫

This little tool allows you to split a larger team into small groups ("tables"), such that few people can chat, casually. 
It makes sure the same people don't meet again all the time, and that tables are filled more or less equally.
It's useful to split into breakout rooms in a video-conference, one "table" per room.

# ❓
You keep the names of the participants in `names.py`; comment people who are not available for a round.
Define how many people should be sitting at each "table" with e.g. `--max 2.4`; this also defines the number of tables generated by this tool.
Tweak this parameter to prevent single participants per table, or tables too full.

# 🧁
Enjoy!
