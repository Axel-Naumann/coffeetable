# Coffee Table! ☕

Suppose you don't manage to have coffees with your colleagues.
Maybe you even have new colleagues you don't even really know, because you never met them, you never hang out. 😞

This little tool allows you to split a larger team into small groups ("tables"), such that few people can chat, casually. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
It makes sure the same people don't meet again all the time, and that tables are filled more or less equally.
It's useful to split into breakout rooms in a video-conference, one "table" per room.

You keep the names of the participants in `names.py`; comment people who are not available for a round.
Define how many people should be sitting at each "table" with e.g. `--max 2.4`; this also defines the number of tables generated by this tool.
Tweak this parameter to prevent single participants per table, or tables too full.

Enjoy! 🧁
